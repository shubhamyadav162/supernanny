      <>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Play is the language of childhood. It's through play that children explore the world around them, experiment with roles, and test boundaries, laying the foundation for future learning, creativity, and social skills.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Cognitive Development</h3>
        <p>Engaging in imaginative play—such as building with blocks or storytelling—sharpens problem-solving skills, fosters creativity, and enhances memory retention. Children learn cause and effect, experiment with new ideas, and develop their attention span.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Social & Emotional Growth</h3>
        <p>Interactive play teaches sharing, negotiation, and empathy. By playing with peers or caregivers, children practice expressing emotions, resolving conflicts, and understanding others' perspectives.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Physical Development</h3>
        <p>Active play—running, jumping, climbing—strengthens gross motor skills and coordination. Fine motor abilities develop through activities like drawing, threading beads, and manipulating small objects.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Practical Tips for Parents & Nannies</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Provide a safe, open space for free play, both indoors and outdoors.</li>
          <li>Offer a variety of toys and materials—blocks, art supplies, dress-up clothes—to spark interest.</li>
          <li>Schedule unstructured playtime daily; allow children to lead the activity.</li>
          <li>Join in play: ask open-ended questions and encourage storytelling.</li>
          <li>Observe without judgment to understand a child's interests and developmental needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By valuing play as a fundamental learning tool, parents and nannies can nurture confident, curious, and well-rounded children.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Entrusting someone with your child's care is one of the most important decisions a parent can make. A nurturing, dependable nanny safeguards your child's well-being, supports their development, and brings peace of mind to your family.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">1. Define Your Family's Needs</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Child's Age & Stage:</strong> Infants require specialized care; preschoolers thrive on learning activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Full-time, part-time, evenings, weekends, and emergency coverage.</li>
          <li><strong>Language & Culture:</strong> Bilingual households or cultural traditions to be respected.</li>
          <li><strong>Special Requirements:</strong> Medical needs, dietary restrictions, or educational goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">2. The Recruitment Process</h2>
        <p>Start by exploring trusted platforms like SuperNanny, local agencies, or referrals from friends. Collect resumes, certificates, and references before proceeding to interviews.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">3. Conducting Effective Interviews</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Ask open-ended questions about past experiences and childcare philosophies.</li>
          <li>Role-play common scenarios: handling tantrums, meal prep, and emergency response.</li>
          <li>Evaluate communication skills, patience, and adaptability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">4. Verification & Background Checks</h2>
        <p>Verify identity documents (Aadhaar, PAN), conduct criminal background checks, and confirm professional certifications. Contact previous employers and personal references for honest feedback.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">5. Trial Period & Onboarding</h2>
        <p>Implement a short trial (3–5 days). Provide a welcome kit: household rules, emergency contacts, daily routine, and the household schedule. Encourage open feedback to align expectations.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">6. Building a Strong Relationship</h2>
        <p>Maintain weekly check-ins, share progress photos, and discuss challenges. Positive reinforcement and clear communication foster trust and a long-lasting partnership.</p>
        <p>By following these steps, you ensure that your chosen nanny becomes a treasured member of your family's support system.</p>
